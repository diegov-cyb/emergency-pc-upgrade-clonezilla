# emergency-pc-upgrade-clonezilla
Upgraded an emergency services PC by migrating the system to an SSD using Clonezilla, validating user profiles, improving storage, configuring secure access, and optimizing performance for faster, more reliable operation.

## **Project Overview**
This project focused on improving the dependability and performance of a PC used in an emergency services environment. The system was fully migrated to a new SSD for faster operation, with the original HDD repurposed for additional storage. The process included data integrity checks, user account verification, system cleaning, and security configuration to ensure uninterrupted services availability.

## **Key Activities Completed**
- Performed a full disk-to-disk clone using Clonezilla
- Migrated the operating system and data from HDD to SSD
- Validated successful boot and system integrity after migration
- Repurposed the old HDD for storage
- Configured RDP for secure remote access
- Managed local user accounts and permissions
- Cleaned the system internally to improve cooling and longevity
- Verified performance improvements and tested system stability
